# Heart-Disease-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Heart Disease UCI Dataset.

## Project Overview
**Objective:** Understand factors associated with heart disease
- Tools: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Dataset: [Heart Disease UCI] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data?resource=download)

## Key Findings:
- Heart disease prevalence increases with age, especially in the 60+ group.
- Asymptomatic chest pain is strongly linked to heart disease.
- Higher maximum heart rate tends to be protective.
- Surprisingly, cholesterol does not show a clear pattern in this dataset.

## Visuals
Plots and figures are saved in the `figures/` folder.

## Reflection
This project helped me practice EDA techniques, data visualization, and understanding clinical data interpretation.
